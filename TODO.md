# Todo

- Root component styles: the django static url is hardcoded here...
- decide which background texture to use
- does normalize.css need to by in styles dir?  cant you just require the actual copy downloaded by npm?
- nginx config file
    + sup with that upstream context? should i be doing that, and is that why alec's --bind was to :9000, etc?
    - where should django admin static files be found?
- upstart config file
